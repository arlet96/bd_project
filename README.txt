The project is for connect a simple database that contains given iformation of mathemathics elements.
The design of the database is simple, it was conciliated with the client.
The first signing step has the values by default because that database was not created because they did not give the
information.
The option "Show curves" is for show the elements of the database. If the user doesn't know the name of the curve, 
he can see all the elements by selecting"Show" with the empty label "CurveName". Otherwise he can specify the name of the curve
that want to see. With "Clean" can delete all the elements of the view.
The option "Add by file" gives the user the opportunity to upgrade the database with new elements by a file with the specific
format of the database.
The option "Delete curve" gives the user the opportunity for delete a curve only knowing the name.
